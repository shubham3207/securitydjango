                        <p class="card-text">Dog grooming services include a lot of nail clipping. The nails
                            of
                            a dog grow, and if they are not clipped properly or in a timely manner, they can
                            grow wildly and curl.
                            This causes discomfort to the dogs and may even puncture their paws. Such events
                            can
                            lead to the dogs contracting more unpleasant ailments. A nail clipper is used to
                            trim your nails.
                            Inexperienced users, on the other hand, might inflict harm to the dog when using
                            it.
                            As a result, expert nail cutting is recommended to keep your dog quiet and
                            relaxed.

                            considered giving your dog a new look?
                            Happy Paws partners, on the other hand, have created some very beautiful
                            haircuts
                            for all breeds of dogs.
                            Haircuts aren't only fashionable; they're also a good method to care for your
                            pet's
                            coat.
                            Shi Tzus, for example, require pet grooming services so that they can see
                            better.
                            Other dogs, such as spaniels, huskies, and lhasa apsos, require regular haircuts
                            as
                            well.
                            Style it according to your own personal preferences and watch your dog go from a
                            bundle of fur to a high-class darling!</p>
